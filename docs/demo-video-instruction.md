# Demo Video Instructions for Framework Integrations

This guide explains how contributors should create a demo video showing framework integration with the **Social Share Button** library.

These videos help other developers understand how to integrate the library with different frameworks such as **React, Next.js, Vue, Angular, Qwik, SolidJS**, etc.

---


## 🎥 Demo Video Requirements

Contributors must follow these requirements when creating the demo video:

- **Duration:** ≤ 150 seconds
- Demonstrate the **framework integration process**
- Show the **setup inside the codebase**
- Demonstrate the **share button rendering correctly on localhost**
- Upload the video to **Google Drive, YouTube, or any platform with public access**
- The video will later be uploaded to the **AOSSIE YouTube channel**
- Add the **public video link to the README demo section**

---


## 📌 What the Video Should Show
The demo video should clearly demonstrate the following steps.

### 1. Repository Setup
Show the repository where the integration is implemented.

You may use:
- A repository from **AOSSIE-Org (preferred)**  
- Or an external demo repository if needed

---

### 2. Framework Integration
Show how the **Social Share Button** is integrated into the framework.

This should include:

- Importing or including the library
- Adding the framework wrapper
- Using the share button inside a component or page

---

### 3. Code Walkthrough
Show the code added for the framework integration.

For example:

social-share-button-qwik.js
social-share-button-solid.js
social-share-button-react.js



Briefly explain how the wrapper connects the framework with the Social Share Button library.

---


## 🧰 Use Official Framework Starters

For testing and demo purposes, contributors should prefer using the **official framework starter templates**.  
These starters generate a **clean project structure with minimal configuration**, which makes the integration easier to demonstrate.

Examples:

### Qwik

npm create qwik@latest
npm install
npm run dev

### Preact
npm create preact@latest

### Remix
npx create-remix@latest

### SolidJS
npx degit solidjs/templates/js my-app

### Rails
rails new my-app

### Django
django-admin startproject myapp

Contributors may use similar official starter commands for other frameworks if needed.


### 4. Running the Project

Run the project locally and demonstrate the button rendering.

Example commands:

npm install
npm run dev


Then open the browser and show the working result:

http://localhost:5173



The share buttons should render correctly on the page.

## ⚠️ Important Note for PR Testing

In many cases, the **new wrapper code only exists in the contributor’s PR branch** and is **not yet included in the released CDN version (for example v1.0.3)**.

If the released CDN version is used, the demo may load **older library code**, which can cause the integration demo to fail.

Therefore, for **testing and demo video recording**, contributors should use **jsDelivr with their branch name**.

Their new wrapper code (e.g., social-share-button-qwik.js) only exists in their PR branch — not in the published v1.0.3 CDN tag.
---


## 🌐 Use jsDelivr for Demo Videos

Use the following CDN format:

```html
<!-- Replace GITHUB_USERNAME and BRANCH_NAME below -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/GITHUB_USERNAME/SocialShareButton@BRANCH_NAME/src/social-share-button.css">

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/GITHUB_USERNAME/SocialShareButton@BRANCH_NAME/src/social-share-button.js"></script>

✅ Example

Example for the Qwik integration branch:

GITHUB_USERNAME: aashnaachaudhary10
BRANCH_NAME: feat/qwik-integration
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/aashnaachaudhary10/SocialShareButton@feat/qwik-integration/src/social-share-button.css">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/aashnaachaudhary10/SocialShareButton@feat/qwik-integration/src/social-share-button.js"></script>
```

This ensures that the demo loads the latest code directly from the contributor's branch.




📹 Reference Demo

Contributors may follow a similar format when creating their framework integration demos.
